# Computer Network Report

I discuss how to write the code with 李沛宸, 林宸宇, 陳德維, and consult ChatGPT and Copilot.

## 1.

1. The client will first ask for the file "dash.mpd", which contains the information of video segments.

2. The client will ask for "init-stream<number>.m4s", which contains the information of different resolution.
3. The client will ask for "chunk-stream<number>-<chunkId>.m4s", this contains the chunk of video the client want.
4. Once the video is out of the buffer range or change resolution, it will return back to step 2.

## 2. 

Theoretical: MP4 is a single file, while DASH can divide original video into several small segments, which allows prefetching and adapting to network condition.

Practical: When dragging time axis to a time point, the entire file of MP4 still needs to be downloaded, which consume a large amount of traffic. On the other hand, DASH don't need to download the skipped segments, so the traffic usage is lower.

## 3.

Workflow: When a client requests to access an endpoint that require authentication, the server will check whether the row "Authentication: Basic <base64 encoded account:password>" exists in the HTTP request header. If yes and the account and password is correct, then the server can let client access the endpoint. Otherwise, send 401 Unauthorized with a row "WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="<whatever>"\r\n". 

I don't think its secure enough because

1. Base64 encoding is easily reversible.
2. The entire authentication process occurs in plaintext, without encryption like HTTPS.
3. Lack of token expiration.

Alternative: OAuth 2.0

## BONUS

How to utilize git: I will push the code after I check it is correct.

Benefit: Since the codebase is large in this homework, it is very likely that you destroy the already finished part. With git, I can easily restore to the old version and check how I messed it up.

I think it is a better way to submit homework via GitHub Classroom because

1. I can utilize version control.
2. TAs can easily know our progress.
3. Online judge.
